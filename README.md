##Testing Bug
SPECS: Sorry for the speed bump, one alert comes up when testing. Just *quickly* click past it and the rest will pass if there is not a timeout. Comment out scripts.js line 18 if you keep getting that timeout.

##Pizza Order
Computes appropriate number of slices according to size and type (cheese or pepperoni). Further functionality to be added to count length of topping inputs and do the "more toppings = more slices" thing with a button to add an additional topping form. Min diameter (inches) is 8 and max is any over 21. If you appreciated this app, buy me a pizza!

jQuery-1.11.2.js

##Project Setup

2. `open triangle.html in google chrome`

##Tests
